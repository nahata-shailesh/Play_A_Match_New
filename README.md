# Play_A_Match_New

 
Have you ever wanted to play a game of tennis, soccer, or even a game of chess, only to find to your dismay that none of your friends is free to play? If you’ve been in this situation, fret no more! PlayAMatch is an IOS application that aims to connect people looking to play a game with others in the area who are looking to play the same game as well. Using PlayAMatch, people can login, view a list of events, create/join events, and chat with other people participating in the same event. So if one Sunday evening you want to play a game of tennis, all you have to do is open up PlayAMatch, find someone else who’s looking to play a game of tennis (by either creating a tennis event or joining an existing one) and then get in touch with him/her via chat messages. This way, you get to burn some calories, meet new people, and have fun playing your favourite game, all at the same time!
